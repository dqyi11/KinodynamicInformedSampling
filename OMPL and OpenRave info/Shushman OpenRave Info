CC'ing Brian (Hey Brian, Rohan is one of the cool MRSD students that has
been working with Sidd on kinodynamic
planning, and has come to many of the recent reading groups. He has been
working on an OMPL planner
and wanted to port that over to the HERB pipeline so I thought I'd get him
in touch with you in case
he needed some assistance).

Hey Rohan,

* This or_ompl  example should be a good reference for calling a HERB 
OpenRave planner with an underlying OMPL planner
-- https://github.com/personalrobotics/or_ompl/blob/master/scripts/example.py

* This script from Chris Dellin's code is an example of an openrave plugin
generator for an OMPL planner -
-- https://github.com/personalrobotics/lemur/blob/master/or_lemur/catkin-env-hooks/20.or_lemur.sh.in

* And this is what defines the behaviour of the plugin. If you make a
separate OMPL package you will need to have one of these (and the above script) -
-- https://github.com/personalrobotics/lemur/blob/master/or_lemur/src/plugin.cpp

* However if your planner builds with OMPL, you can just edit the following file on your local
copy of or_ompl -
-- https://github.com/personalrobotics/or_ompl/blob/master/planners.yaml
-- This will generate the plugin for your planner automatically.

Hope that helps!
Shushman
